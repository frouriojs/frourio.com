Even if you write both the frontend and backend in TypeScript, you can't statically type-check the API's sparsity.  
We are always forced to write "Two TypeScript".  
We waste a lot of time on dynamic testing using the browser and server.

Frourio is a framework for developing web apps quickly and safely in **"One TypeScript"**.

Frourio requires TypeScript 3.9 or newer.  
If the TypeScript version of VSCode is low, an error is displayed during development.
