## What is aspida?

Before we learn about fourio, we need to know about aspida.

Aspida is an HTTP client wrapper for type safety.
Let's look at the real example to see what this means.

For example, if you make an API request using `fetch`, the response in the client will be `any`.

![typed as any](/img/docs/fetch.png)

Aspida converts it to an object of the type defined in the type definition, making it easier for the client to handle.

In this example, we used `@aspida/fetch`, which wraps fetch, but there are other wrappers such as axios and SWR.

## Remaining problems

There are still a few problems with aspida.

First, there is no guarantee that the server will respond according to the type definition.
Aspida types according to the defined type definition, so if the server breaks it, a runtime error will occur.
There is no way to detect this as aspida has no validation capabilities.

Second, if you are using server-generated OpenAPI, you need to convert it through `openapi2aspida` every time.
Many server frameworks generate OpanAPI based on their implementations, but using them in aspida requires conversion through `openapi2aspida`.

Frourio solves these problems by "implementing with the same type definitions in the server-side TS".

## What is frourio?

Frourio is a CLI tool that generates bridge files and enables type-driven development for static type checking with TypeScript between client and server.

You can easily build projects with any combination of client and server frameworks that frourio supports.
