Welcome to the frourio basic tutorial.

In this tutorial, we will learn about aspida and frourio using a basic client + server project built by create-vite and Fastify.

## Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial is to

- Understand how frourio works
- Set up frourio without create-frourio-app

## Environment

- **create-vite** with **react-ts template**  
  It is also possible to set up the client by yourself.
- **npm**  
  It is also possible to use yarn, pnpm, or others.
- **tsx**  
  It is also possible to use ts-node or others.

Due to the nature of the full-stack framework, the four CLI tools are finally launched in parallel.
We recommend using tabs in the terminal itself, tmux, etc.

Also, as there will be situations where type errors are being checked, we recommend an environment where help such as IntelliSense is available.

Directory and file operations are described in terms of UNIX commands; Windows users not using WSL should read accordingly.
